% sets default values of parameters for the McDermott and Simoncelli sound
% texture synthesis algorithm.
%
% The sound file from which the statistics are to be measured is
% specified as a string in the variable P.orig_sound_filename; you will
% probably want to change this to your own sound file.
%
% The folder from which the sound file should be read is specified as a
% string in P.orig_sound_folder.
%
% The folder to which the synthetic result and accompanying files should be
% saved is specified as a string in P.output_folder.

% This code is part of an instantiation of a sound texture synthesis
% algorithm developed with Eero Simoncelli and described in this paper:
