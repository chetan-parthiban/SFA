Generations w/ different timbre or pitch to see if it can pick up invariances
Speaker identity testing

1) Parabolas w/ comodulated noise (usually ~20 Hz modulations)
2) Adding in clutter for noise -- [noise with random freq, # of freqs, duration, fm, am]
3) Transformations [speed, loudness, pitch, timbre?, reverb, off axis changes]

Maria Geffen (Journal Neurophysiology) - transformations?

Do speed/loudness in different ways (continous trajectories, randomized values)

Do we learn objects first or transformations?
